# Crio Capstone Challenge '19

As a part of the Crio Capstone Challenge (post the Micro Experience), I teamed up with [Jayesh Sharma](https://github.com/WJayesh) and [Bashar Jaan Khan](https://github.com/thisHermit?tab=repositories) and we worked on a Chatbot for Contextual Post Order Queries. The chat bot was built using the Dialogflow API and integrated with Google Assistant. It utilized the back-end we built during CSoD '19. Flows like cancelling an order, status inquiry, reordering a previously placed order were implemented.

Out of 35 teams that participated, our project was featured in the top 10. The chatbot demo can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AB5gBmxA11_s0RECXKku5A8eUEMj6gct)
